# UI/UX Prototype — CLAUDE.md (reusable template)

A clickable, **design-system-driven UI prototype** with mock data. Fill in the
**Per-project** block below, drop your design-system skill in `.claude/skills/`,
your tokens in `src/styles/index.css`, and build. Everything else is
product-agnostic and reads from the block.

## Per-project — fill these in
- **Product:** Wael Academy — a warm, on-brand clickable prototype of the Wael Academy education product (a Tunisian academy). Screens-only, mock data, no backend.
- **Design-system skill:** `wael-design-system-soft` (in `.claude/skills/` — read it before building any surface)
- **UI language:** French — set once, stay consistent. (For Arabic later: `dir="rtl"` + logical utilities `ps-`/`me-`/`start-`.)
- **Entities:** _TBD — decide as screens are built (likely students, teachers, courses, sessions, enrollments, payments); keep in sync with `src/data/seed/`._
- **Real backend schema?** none — in-memory prototype (state resets on refresh).

---

This is a **prototype, not a real app.** Goal: screens that look exactly like the
product, navigate between each other, **and behave like real data** — add / edit /
delete persist across screens and ripple into other views. **No backend and no
network:** all data lives in a single in-memory store, seeded on load. A designer
is delivering this to demo look-and-feel, flow, and core interactions.

## TIER 1 — Hard rules
- **Design-first.** Every screen/component uses the project's design-system skill in `.claude/skills/`. Read it before building anything. Match it exactly.
- **Prefer tokens over hex.** Use the semantic tokens from `src/styles/index.css` (e.g. `bg-brand-600`, `text-ink-muted`, `border-border`). Raw hex is allowed only when no token fits — leave a comment explaining why.
- **In-memory data.** A single React Context store at the app root holds all data, seeded on load from `src/mock/data.ts`. Screens read from it and mutate via add / update / remove, so create/edit/delete persist across navigation and show up in other screens. No fetch, no API, no async, no server, no runtime schemas. In memory only — resets on refresh.
- **No real business logic.** Only simple add/edit/delete plus derived display values (counts, rates, totals, "X/Y" summaries, basic sort/filter). Do NOT implement the product's real engine — no domain algorithms, scheduling, scoring, pricing, or workflow rules.
- **Everything navigates.** Buttons, tabs, cards, back arrows route to real screens. The demo must feel clickable end to end. Use placeholder screens for anything not built yet, never dead buttons.
- **Routes, not tab state.** Top-level tabs/screens are nested React Router routes (one URL each). Global data lives in the store; only in-screen UI (open modals, form inputs, filters) uses local state.
- **No over-engineering.** The store is a plain React Context + `useReducer`/`useState` — NOT a library; new-row IDs use the built-in `crypto.randomUUID()`. Don't add redundant infrastructure (Zustand, Redux, TanStack Query, Zod, MSW, react-hook-form, a component/UI kit like shadcn) unless asked. Real capability libraries (charts, drag-and-drop, canvas, etc.) are fine when a screen genuinely needs one — see Stack.

## TIER 2 — Craft: think UX & creativity on every screen
Before building any screen or component, think like a designer, not a code generator:
- **Purpose first.** Who is on this screen and what is the ONE thing they came to do? Make that primary action the most obvious element; everything else is secondary and visually quieter.
- **Make it feel alive.** Seed varied, believable content in the product's language — different names, a mix of statuses, an edge case (an error/forfeit/overdue), a long name, a near-full and an empty record. Identical rows look fake; variety looks real.
- **Design every state, not just the happy one.** Think through the empty state, the "lots of data" state, and the selected/active state. A thoughtful empty card ("Nothing here yet…") sells the prototype more than a full one. (Empty states also appear after a user deletes everything — handle that.)
- **Interactions must respond.** Hover, active tab, selected row, pressed button, and visible feedback on actions (a brief inline/toast-style confirmation). Clicking should always *feel* like something happened.
- **Hierarchy & rhythm.** Most important info biggest and first; supporting info muted (`text-ink-muted`). Keep a consistent spacing rhythm and let screens breathe.
- **Creative WITHIN the system.** The design-system skill is the ceiling for style — never invent a new palette, font, or foreign look. (A rare one-off hex per the Tier 1 rule is fine; a new color *system* is not.) Creativity means thoughtful composition, good empty-state ideas, and smart use of the existing tokens and components.
- **When the system doesn't define something,** don't guess randomly: open 2-3 of the closest existing screens/components, study their spacing, density, and feeling, and extend that. A new screen must look like it belongs to the same family. State which screens you referenced.
- **Tasteful restraint.** Polish with intent (an icon, a status dot, a progress bar) — don't over-decorate. Clean and considered beats busy.

End each screen by stating, in one line, the main UX/creative decision you made.

## Stack (keep it minimal)
- Vite + React + TypeScript.
- Tailwind v4 (tokens via `src/styles/index.css`) + `lucide-react` icons.
- React Router for screen navigation. React Context for the in-memory data store.

If asked for something this stack can't cleanly do (drag-and-drop, interactive
canvas, charts, virtualization, complex animations, etc.), don't get stuck on the
list — read the use case, pick the best-fit library for the job, install it, and
use it. The "minimal" rule is about avoiding bloat (UI kits, convenience libs,
redundant state managers), not about refusing real capability needs.

## Data layer (in-memory store)
- One provider, `src/data/DataProvider.tsx`, mounted at the app root (wraps the router). It loads `src/mock/data.ts` into state on first render.
- It exposes the collections plus per-entity actions: `add<Entity>` / `update<Entity>` / `remove<Entity>`, the same shape for each.
- Screens read and mutate through a `useData()` hook — never import `mock/data.ts` directly.
- New rows get `crypto.randomUUID()` ids. Existing seed rows keep readable slug ids (`entity-slug`).
- Derived values (counts, rates, "X/Y" summaries) are COMPUTED from the store in render — never stored.
- In memory only; state resets on page refresh. (If asked, persistence can later be added via `localStorage` — not by default.)

## Reference docs (/docs) — optional
- If the project has a real backend schema (Prisma, SQL, OpenAPI…), put it in `/docs` as **reference only.** Never copy it into the app. When the data needs a field, look up its real name / relationship there.
- `docs/data-plan.md` — the prototype data slice: the entities and only the fields the screens show. **The types and the seed in `src/mock/data.ts` follow this file.**

Data rules:
- Use the real field names where a schema exists. IDs are strings. Give related entities the parent id they belong to.
- Model only what the screens show. Do NOT model backend-only constructs (engine internals, join tables, derived pipelines). When a value isn't decided yet, a plain placeholder string is fine.
- Read `docs/data-plan.md` before editing `src/mock/data.ts`, the store, or any screen that shows data. Add a field only when a screen needs it, taking it from the schema.

## Structure (flat, screen-based)
```
docs/
  schema.*                  # real backend — reference only (if any)
  data-plan.md              # prototype data slice (shapes for the store + seed)
src/
  main.tsx  App.tsx         # App.tsx = <DataProvider> wrapping the router
  styles/index.css          # @import "./tokens.css"
  data/
    DataProvider.tsx        # app-root Context store, seeded from mock/data.ts; add/update/remove
    useData.ts              # useData() hook screens call to read + mutate
  mock/data.ts              # SEED data (initial values), shaped per docs/data-plan.md
  shells/
    AppShell.tsx            # sidebar + topbar (top level)
    SectionShell.tsx        # optional: back-header + tab bar for a nested section
  components/               # shared UI from the design system (Avatar, StatusBadge, Card, ProgressBar, EmptyState, DataTable, Modal, Tabs…)
  screens/
    <List>.tsx              # a top-level list screen
    <section>/              # a section that owns several sub-screens
      <ScreenA>.tsx  <ScreenB>.tsx  …
    <other top-level screens>.tsx
```

## Conventions
- UI strings in the product's language (set once; it's the product language).
- Reuse shared components from `components/` — don't re-style the same thing twice.
- Screens read and mutate data only through `useData()`. `src/mock/data.ts` is the seed and the single source of truth for initial content (the same records appear everywhere).
- Empty states where they make the demo look real (an empty card; an emptied list after deletes). No spinners faking network calls.
- Light/dark theme toggle is a nice-to-have via `data-theme` on `<html>` (if the tokens support it).

## Autonomy
- Run any terminal/bash command you need on your own — install deps, start/stop the dev server, build, typecheck, run git, move or rename files, run scripts. **Don't pause to ask for permission; just run it and keep building.** Call out only the notable ones (a new dependency added, or anything destructive).

## Commands
- `npm run dev` · `npm run build` · `npm run preview` · typecheck: `npx tsc -b`

## Workflow
- Build screen by screen, on-brand, wired into the router and the store as you go. Show each screen as it lands.
